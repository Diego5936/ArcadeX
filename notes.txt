Uppercase Null is a typecast. When setting a new global variable inside a module/class.
Ex: var x as Array or Null;

Lowercase null is an actual value. When initializing a variable to nothing.
Ex: var x = null;
    if (x == null) {
        System.println("Var is empty");
    }

When handling an action event (onSwipe, onKey, etc...) the function need to return a boolean to let the system know if our function handled that input> if handled then returns true, if not then it passes it upward to be handleed instead.

WatchUi.getCurrentView() holds a view pair [view, delegate]. If needing one specifically got to separate.
Ex: var viewPair = WatchUi.getCurrentView();
    view = viewPair[0] as ArcadeXView;
